Note:
* This plugin will overwrite some open popup method for "create table", "merge cells" etc. 
* The original editor_plugin_src.js is changed name to editor_plugin_src.js.orig. If upgrade tinymce version, it may need
compare this original file with new version, then update revised version correspondingly.  
* All Edgenius tinymce plugin javascript are not compressed, but I try to use compress version for others, so, the editor_plugin.js has  
same content editor_plugin_src.js.
